The following is the code for the paper"Passenger Counting in Mass Public Transport Systems using Computer Vision and Deep Learning" in IEEE transactions.

Estimating the number of people in vehicles and stations in public transport systems is crucial to improve the quality of service. The TransMilenio system in Bogot√° has serious drawbacks related to the lack of information in congestion situations. In this work, we present a computer vision method that estimates the number of people in TransMilenio's  boarding platforms using deep learning techniques. We release the TransMilenio-Javeriana dataset with nearly 900,000 head labels on buses and stations. From these images, a deep learning architecture tuned for crowd counting was trained to generate density maps around the heads in the scene. Several head count methods were evaluated on the density maps. After testing these methods with 10,800 images, the results show a mean absolute error of 1 head per frame, equivalent to 11% relative error. The accuracy found is much better than its manual counterpart. The proposed system is also scalable and low-cost, which indicates that it has great potential to provide information for the planning and operation of public transport systems.
